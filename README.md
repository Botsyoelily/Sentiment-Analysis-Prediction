# Sentiment-Analysis-Prediction
Description:
This project explores sentiment analysis on YouTube comments to predict the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Using Python, Google Colab, and the YouTube Data API, the code retrieves video comments for each candidate and analyzes their sentiment using the TextBlob library. This experimental project demonstrates how machine learning and sentiment analysis can gauge public opinion, with limitations around dataset size and sentiment complexity.

Key Features:

Fetches YouTube video comments for specified keywords (e.g., "Kamala Harris 2024" and "Donald Trump 2024")
Analyzes comment sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative
Aggregates sentiment scores to make a prediction based on public opinion
Provides an educational demonstration of sentiment analysis techniques
Note: To use this code, you will need a YouTube API key from the Google Developers Console.
